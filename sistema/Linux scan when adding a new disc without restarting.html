First find your host bus number<br />
<br />
grep mpt /sys/class/scsi_host/host?/proc_name<br />
<br />
Which should return a line like<br />
<br />
/sys/class/scsi_host/host0/proc_name:mptspi<br />
<br />
where host0 is the relevant field.<br />
<br />
use this to rescan the bus with the following command<br />
<br />
echo &#34;- - -&#34; > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan<br />
<br />
In the above command the the hyphens represent controller,channel,lun, so – – – indicates all controllers, all channels and all luns should be scanned.<br />
<br />
